	  comment: Finished implementation of makeNum, and added a copy of the dracula folder to the resources directory for reference. In the process of changing everything to work with lists of bytes instead of strings because this is a binary format and UTF8 string encoding could really screw us if we used string.

	  comment: Added a temporary function to make sure this all works with real files which it does. Found out the PNGs can have multiple IDAT sections, and that each IDAT section seems to cap out at 8192 bytes (at least the reference image output from GIMP does).

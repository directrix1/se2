comment: Talked with Micah about doing stuff with image formats.  Talked about doing something with PNG, since it's such a simple format.  Gave an overview of APNG.  Found at at team meeting that Kye and Ed were discussing the same thing independently, and wanted to work with APNG.  Came to an agreement with others to do APNG stuff.

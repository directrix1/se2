@title{@bold{Dracula}: A Guide to ACL2 in DrScheme}

This manual provides an introduction to Dracula, the programming environment for
the ACL2 theorem prover in DrScheme.  See section 1 for instructions on
installing, upgrading, and uninstalling Dracula.  See section 2 for a tutorial
on running and verifying programs using Dracula and ACL2.  Section 3 introduces
DoubleCheck, the teachpack for using automated testing to check your
conjectures.  Section 4 introduces Modular ACL2, an extension of ACL2 that
supports systematic, piece-by-piece development and verification of ACL2 proofs.

See @other-manual[(make-dracula-spec "reference/reference.scrbl")] for a full
description of Dracula's languages and libraries in detail, or
@link["http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/"]{the ACL2 home page} for more
information on the ACL2 theorem prover.

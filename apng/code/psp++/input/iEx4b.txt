	  comment: incomplete design, created total of three steps, now need to define what functions i'll reuse and create and estimate their size

	  comment: had not considered the three higher order methods that represent the main three steps, parse-xml, format-xml-string, and formatted-string-to-html

	  comment: when creating html didn't interpret formatted string right, hands are assumed to be in N E S W, but html order was N S E W. As a result mixed up which hands had which cards.

	  comment: While writing check-expects figured out that the formatted-string-to-html should be much easier than I expected, which eliminates the need for the helper methods: hand-to-html, suit-to-html, cards-to-html.

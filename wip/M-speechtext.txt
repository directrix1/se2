As for the actual development timeline, we decided to closely follow the deliverable schedule provided by Dr. Page.

This schedule we were given 

To create an animation, we need to provide the software with several pieces of information.

For this we decided to use an XML structure, because it is very effective at organizing data in a human accessable format. It's also easy to interpret and manipulate as a document object model on the software side.

The information required to build a png is:
	The number of images, or frames
	The number of times the animation will loop.
	and a list of PNG filenames to be used with their associated time as a fraction of a second.

   IapngExploder

   Takes an APNG file and explodes it into PNG files.

(module MapngExploder

  ; Given an APNG file, breaks the APNG into its constituent PNG Images.
  ; This process involves looking at the acTL chunk to determine number of
  ; frames and number of plays, as well as looking at the fcTL and fdAT
  ; pairs to reconstruct the IHDR and IDAT chunks of the PNG Images that
  ; comprise the APNG input.
  ; Output is as follows:
  ;	APNG â†’ (	numFrames numPlays 
  ;			(framedata1 time_for_frame1)
  ;			(framedata2 time_for_frame2)
  ;			... 					)
  ; apngdata = raw apng data string given from the IO Module.
  ; Output is a list of lists: (file-data, file-name)

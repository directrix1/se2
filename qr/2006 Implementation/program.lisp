#| RUN THIS FILE!!!
to create a QRCode image run the command
(encode content ecLevel output)

content is a string of what you wish to encode

ecLevel can be one of four options:
  (EC:L) = ~7% correction
  (EC:M) = ~15% correction
  (EC:Q) = ~25% correction
  (EC:H) = ~30% correction

output is a string of the output file name for the image you wish to create

EXAMPLE:
(encode "Software Engineering is Fun!" (EC:H) "output.bmp")
this command will encode the string "Software Engineering is Fun!"
into an image file called "output.bmp" with an ErrorCorrectionLevel of high.
